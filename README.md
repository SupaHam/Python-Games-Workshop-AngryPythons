# Python-Games-Workshop - AngryPythons

This is a simple implementation of an Angry-Birds-like game with simple projectile physics. <br>
The graphics library used is the Simple object oriented graphics library by John Zelle. <br>
Physics simulation is based on kinematics equations (SUVAT) and simple look-ahead collision logic. <br>

This is a simplified version of the game with fixed levels and no options menu, 
but still featuring projectile simulation, including gravity and elasticity (bouncing).

Check out the 'master' branch for the full version of the game, but with a more complex code base:
