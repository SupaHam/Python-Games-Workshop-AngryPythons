# Python-Games-Workshop - AngryPythons

This is a simple implementation of an Angry-Birds-like game with simple projectile physics. <br>
The graphics library used is the Simple object oriented graphics library by John Zelle. <br>
Physics simulation is based on kinematics equations (SUVAT) and simple look-ahead collision logic. <br>

This is the full version of the game which features:
- Randomly generated levels
- Projectile simulation - including gravity and elasticity (bouncing)
- Fully customisable simulation settings: <br>
You change everything from gravity, to elasticity, to surface friction using the options menu.

Check out the 'simplified' branch for a cut down version of the game with a simpler code base: <br>
